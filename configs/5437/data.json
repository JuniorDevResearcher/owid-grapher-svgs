An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\n\nDeaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources.\n\nParticipating jurisdictions: see https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/d6p8-wqjm for up-to-date information.\n\nIncidence rate estimates: Weekly age-specific incidence rates by vaccination status were calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of people either fully vaccinated (cumulative) or unvaccinated (obtained by subtracting the cumulative number of fully vaccinated and current number of partially vaccinated people from the 2019 U.S. intercensal population estimates) and multiplied by 100,000. Overall incidence rates were age-standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population. Rates are not adjusted for time since vaccination, underlying conditions, or other demographic factors besides age."
