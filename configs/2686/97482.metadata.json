Values for the United Kingdom and Spain represent the time spent with the doctor after a nurse or assistant has taken basic health measures from the patient. Data taken from Table 2 of the paper linked above.\n\nUnderlying sources: : India—Das and Hammer (2007); Paraguay—Das and Sohnesen (2007); Tanzania—based on calculations by Kenneth Leonard; International Comparisons—Hogelzeir et al. (1993) and Deveugele, Derese, Brink-Muinen, Bensing, and De Maeseneer (2003).\n\nThe timing of recorded values differ country to country. Hence, cross country comparisons should be made with caution. See the underlying sources for further information on the countries included and dates surveys were conducted."
