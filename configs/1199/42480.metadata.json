    "additionalInfo": "The number of people who are undernourished was derived by combining several datasets: data prior to 2005 was derived using the prevalence of undernourishment (%) from World Bank, World Development Indicators and the UN FAO State of Food Insecurity 2017; and global population figures utilised by the UN FAO database. Multiplying these figures allow for the calculation of the absolute number of people undernourished.\n\nData from 2005 onwards is taken from the UN SOFI (2018) report.\n\nThe number of people with sufficient caloric intake (i.e. not undernourished) was calculated as the difference between total population and number of people undernourished.\n\nReferences:\n\nWorld Bank, World Development Indicators. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator [accessed 25th September 2017].\n\nFAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. 2017.
