At each wave, participants were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule to measure DSM-III or DSM-III-R major depressive disorder. They were asked to describe episodes of depression so far in their lifetimes. Between waves, some people developed depression for the first time. However, other people did not recall episodes that they had described in previous waves. This dataset therefore compares lifetime prevalence based on retrospective recall at each wave versus cumulative recall (across waves of the study).\nFailure to recall lifetime mental disorders was defined as not meeting criteria for the lifetime history of the mental disorder at wave 4 despite reporting symptoms that met criteria for that disorder at 1 or more previous waves."
