(2016) developed a database of energy-related accidents over the period from 1950 to 2014. They define an accident as: \"an unintentional incident or event at an energy facility that led to either one death (or more) or at least $50,000 in property damage.\"\n\nThis database was developed based on a series of academic databases (including ScienceDirect and EBSCO host) as well as the internet (using Google and Safari).\n\nThe normalized death rate data is presented by Sovacool et al. (2016) as the number of deaths per TWh over the period from 1990 to 2013."
