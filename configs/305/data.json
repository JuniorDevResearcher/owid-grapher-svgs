The data shown reflect the share of respondents answering “yes” (the other response categories being “no”, and “don’t know”) to the survey question: “In this country, do you have confidence in… national government? Due to small sample sizes, country averages for horizontal inequalities (by age, gender, and education) are pooled between 2010-18 to improve the accuracy of the estimates. The sample is ex-ante designed to be nationally representative of the population aged 15 and over. This indicator is measured as a percentage of all survey respondents.\n\nWe show this metric as the population-weighted average of all OECD member states."
