  "description": "Total proved reserves of coal are generally taken to be those quantities that geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The data series for total proved coal reserves does not necessarily meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, nor does it necessarily represent BPâ€™s view of proved reserves by country. Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio: If the reserves remaining at the end of any year are divided by the production in that year, the result is the length of time that those remaining reserves would last if production were to continue at that rate.",

    "additionalInfo": "BP's region definitions sometimes differ from Our World in Data's definitions. For example, BP's North America includes only Canada, Mexico and United States, whereas Our World in Data's North America includes countries in Central America (see a map with <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions\">our region definitions</a>). For this reason, we include in the dataset regions like \"North America (BP)\" to refer to BP's original data using their definition of the region, as well as \"North America\", which is data aggregated by Our World in Data using our definition. These aggregates are constructed by adding up (when possible) the contributions from the countries in the region.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/using-the-review/definitions-and-explanatory-notes.html#accordion_Regional%20definitions\">BP's region definitions</a>, denoted with \"(BP)\", are:\n* \"Asia Pacific (BP)\": Brunei, Cambodia, China (Mainland), China Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region), China Macau SAR (Special Administrative Region), Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, North Korea, Philippines, Singapore, South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Oceania.\n* \"Australasia (BP)\": Australia, New Zealand.\n* \"CIS (BP)\" - Commonwealth of Independent States: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan.\n* \"Caribbean (BP)\": Atlantic islands between the US Gulf Coast and South America, including Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and Bermuda.\n* \"Central America (BP)\": Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama\n* \"Eastern Africa (BP)\": Territories on the east coast of Africa from Sudan to Mozambique. Also Madagascar, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe.\n* \"Europe (BP)\": European members of the OECD plus Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Georgia, Gibraltar, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine.\n* \"Middle Africa (BP)\": Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Sao Tome & Principe.\n* \"Middle East (BP)\": Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria.\n* \"Non-OECD (BP)\" - Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development: All countries that are not members of the OECD.\n* \"North America (BP)\": US (excluding US territories), Canada, Mexico\n* \"Northern Africa (BP)\": Territories on the north coast of Africa from Egypt to Western Sahara.\n* \"OECD (BP)\" - Organization For Economic Co-operation and Development: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,  Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, US.\n* \"OPEC (BP)\" - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Libya, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Venezuela.\n* \"South and Central America (BP)\": Caribbean (including Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands), Bermuda, Central and South America.\n* \"Southern Africa (BP)\": Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland.\n* \"Western Africa (BP)\": Territories on the west coast of Africa from Mauritania to Nigeria, including Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Mali and Niger.\n\nAdditionally, BP includes some regions that are not explicitly defined (e.g. \"Other Europe (BP)\", or \"Other CIS (BP)\"). We define our regions in the following way:\n* \"Africa\" - All African countries + \"Other Africa (BP)\".\n* \"Asia\" - All Asian countries + \"Other Middle East (BP)\" + \"Other CIS (BP)\" + \"Other Asia Pacific (BP)\".\n* \"Europe\" - All European countries + \"Other Europe (BP)\".\n* \"North America\" - All North American countries + \"Other Caribbean (BP)\" + \"Other North America (BP)\".\n* \"Oceania\" - All Oceanian countries.\n* \"South America\" - All South American countries + \"Other South America (BP)\".\nWhere the individual countries in each region are defined <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions\">in this map</a>. Additional BP regions are ignored, since they belong to other regions already included (e.g. the data for \"Other Western Africa (BP)\" is included in \"Other Africa (BP)\"). Finally, income groups are constructed following the definitions <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-banks-income-groups\">in this map</a>.\n"
